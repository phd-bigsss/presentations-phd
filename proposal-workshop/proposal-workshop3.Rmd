# Paper 1

.medium[
- social comparison: focus on .bold[income distance] (own income vs perceived income) from high and low-status groups 
  
  - to what extent does distance influence subjective status? (study 1) 
  
  - does subjective social status influence preference for redistribution? (study 2)
  - does country-level income inequality mitigate the link between SSS and redistributive preferences?

# Paper 2

.medium[
- social comparison: focus on routinary contact with high and low-status groups as upward-downward experiences of comparison

  - do experiences of social comparison influence policy preferences?
  
  - does economic segregation mitigate the association of comparison and policy preferences?

- possible to replicate with cross-country data (study 1) and longitudinal data (study 2). 

- .bold[idea:] estimate the causal effect of contact (e.g. matching)]

# Paper 3

.small[- focus on experimentally manipulating comparison through vignettes
- vignettes are hypothetical subjects that are randomly assigned to a respondent to test how the attributes (stimuli) of the vignette can affect responses

- ideas of outcomes measures:
	- policy benefit 
	- increase taxes


- H1: egalitarian or self-interest (high income: high taxes, less benefit)

- H2: humanitarian motivation (based on need criteria)

- H3: parochial altruism ("for those who are in need, but similar to me")

# In progress

- the role of social network composition as a source of social comparison (inferential space hypothesis)

- better argument for local income inequality and segregation (contact hypothesis)
