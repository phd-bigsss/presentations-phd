# Background

* To what extent do individuals _prefer_ that the government _intervene_ on different spheres of social/economic inequality?  

* Literature has paid more attention to .bold[material interests], .bold[social mobility] or .bold[values/ideology] (among others)  

* .bold[Subjective] aspects of inequality have been set aside on explaining redistributive preferences (but, increasing)

* Increasing discussion about the role of .bold[social comparison] and .bold[reference groups] on subjective social status

---
# Social comparison and subjective status

* How do individuals .bold[perceive] themselves in the social hierarchy?

* .bold[Social comparison] (Festinger, 1954) and .bold[reference groups] (Merton, 1968) 

* _avaliability heuristic_ mechanism: a "social closure" generated by .bold[homophily] and .bold[homogeneity] of reference groups led to biased estimations (Evans, 2004)

# Study 1: 

**Title:** "Economic Inequality, Subjective Social Status and preference for redistribution: A multilevel cross-national study (1992*-2019)".

* *Objective:* Compare the relation between subjective social status and redistributive preferences over time in different national contexts with heterogeneous levels of economic inequality.

<br>

**Title:** "Subjective Social Status and the demand for redistribution in a highly unequal context: A longitudinal analysis of the case of Chile (2016-2022*)."

* *Objective:* Determine the effect of variations in subjective social status on redistributive preferences in Chile.
