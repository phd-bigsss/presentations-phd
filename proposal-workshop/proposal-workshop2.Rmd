# Preferences formation

### Janmaat (2013): 

  - **Perception** $\rightarrow$ .bold[descriptive] (_how is_)
  - **Beliefs** $\rightarrow$ .bold[normative] (_should be_). 
  - preference as the function of both. 
  - assumes preferences to be more static (than dynamic)

* Perception refer to the idea of "how inequality is"
* Belief refer to the idea of "how inequality should be"
* the "gap" or difference between both can be interpreted as the preference
* I say that is " more static" because the approach empathises the "internal" and normative dimension

# Preferences formation

### Druckman & Lupia (2000): 

  - evaluation of an external object and it's attributes to be .bold[ranked].
  - preferences as the function of .bold[_beliefs_]. 
  - assume preferences to be dynamic (beliefs = information + perception)

]

???

* In my view, because this approach posit that preferences are linked to beliefs, information shocks or life experiences can "update" individuals beliefs. It doesn't focus on the normative dimension at all. At least in a explicit way.

# Balance (until now)

- Janmaat's approach:
  - .bold[pros]: distinguish descriptive vs normative. 
  - .bold[cons]: not too clear about what a preference is. Focus on normative dimension.
 
   
- Druckman & Lupia approach: 
  - .bold[pros]: clear definition and model about _what is_ a preference.
  - .bold[cons]: norms (or ideology) does not play any role. Focus on information and cognitive dimension.

# Social comparison and subjective status

* How do individuals .bold[perceive] themselves in the social hierarchy?

* .bold[Social comparison] (Festinger, 1954) and .bold[reference groups] (Merton, 1968) 

* _avaliability heuristic_ mechanism: a "social closure" generated by .bold[homophily] and .bold[homogeneity] of reference groups led to biased estimations (Evans, 2004)

The one on the left is a book by Condon and Wichowsky in which they discuss the role of cross-class comparison. 

But, they use low and high **income** as synonyms of class 

- they don't focus on other status aspects as education or occupation.

This is the theoretical model of Condon and Wichowsky. I am using this model as a base for inspiration.

The book is focused on the US. So, I think that it would be necessary to go further and test it on different societal contexts (with the available sources or primary data).

## Close reference groups

**key topics**:

* SES composition of reference groups 

* the micro-foundation of status perception

* is this social comparison? 
]

???

In this article the authors used agent based modelling to test


1) socioeconomic homophily of social networks (how heterogeneous is your network)

and  

2) they also simulate the self-allocation of agents in a 10 point scale

# Ideas

Theory-related: 

- role of spatial segregation: _worth it?_ (at least for the 1st)

- .bold[social networks] is a field by itself... (maybe for the 2nd)

Not .bold[_so_] theory-related:

- social comparison: direct (ISSP 2019) or indirect (ISSP 99-19) 
- subjective social status (ISSP 92-19) üîç

???
* On the "theory side" I am still thinking about the role of spatial segregation. Maybe for the cross-national comparison would not be possible to discuss because of the "scale".

* I am interested to include the social network literature, but probably it would be better to go that way on the 2nd paper.

* Of course, I am always checking for the data that I am planning to use and check if it is possible to measure or at least have proxies for my variables.

  - this mean a trade off between
    - time comparison and; 
    - compare measures (direct vs indirect)

These are survey questions

The questions on the left represent what I call **direct** downward and upward comparison

The figure on the right side represent what I call **indirect** downward and upward comparison

- And represent the gap between the respondent's income household income and a Unskilled Worker or a CEO of a company as proxy of comparison.
